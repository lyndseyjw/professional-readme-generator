## A README Generator Created From Command Line User Input

Here we have a Professional README Generator where users can answer prompts that are related to sections within a professional README. Users are able to answer questions about their project, which will create a professionally formatted README file for them to include in their project. 

To find out how to use this application, I invite you to view this video : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WCkbBztMlU1elmmIWDYMR8m5N0vURfLt/view

Here is an example of what the command prompts will be : [command-line-user-prompts]('./assets/images/command-line-user-prompts.png')

& an example of a README generated using the answers from these prompts : [example-readme-generated]('./assets/images/example-readme-generated.png')

This project was a wonderful integration of various file types. I enjoyed creating a readme format & integrating this into the index.js file so that this format was generated upon completion of the user prompts. I was able to strengthen my node skills & built confidence in template literal syntax. Screencastify was also a new endeavor for me & was great practice in concise application description.
